<h1>Bank Leumi Salesforce Hackathon</h1>
===============================

Resources for participants of the Bank Leumi Salesforce Hackathon

<h1>I registered, now what?</h1>
To get started you can browse the section <bold><a href="http://hackleumi.bemyapp.com/we-QA.php">Q&A</a></bold> of the <a href="http://hackleumi.bemyapp.com/">Bank Leumi Hackathon site</a>. There are some very good links that will help you get started.

But if you have kept reading click <a href="http://ccoenraets.github.io/salesforce-developer-workshop/index.html">here</a> to start a tutorial in Force.com, and <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/signup?d=70130000000hUZp">register for your first Salesforce instance!</a>

Remember that <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/salesforce1/">Salesforce 1</a> is not only <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/sales-cloud/overview/?d=70130000000tdXy">Sales</a>, and <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/service-cloud/overview/?d=70130000000tdY3">Service</a>, it is also <a href="https://code.exacttarget.com/getting-started/">Marketing</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.articles.meta/articles/">Heroku</a> and a extensive ecosystem of <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/">ISV applications</a> that run on it!

But here we focus in <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.workbook.meta/workbook/">Force.com</a>

<h3>To have a quick start the day of the Hackathon</h3>
Also we have been working to smooth your setup and help you get ready quickly with a suggested data model.

First we pre-created several <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/An_Introduction_to_Environments">ORGs</a> that you can ask for the very first day of the Hackathon. These ORGs have the data model, data uploaded and the translations in Hebrew.

We hope you will apreciatte the help. Although starting to explore <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/salesforce1/">Salesforce 1</a> the same day is not the best path of action.

So, Second, we packaged the data model and you can register for a DEV ORG and install it. And start hacking around!

The link to install the data model is here:

<a href="https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t200000006Vut">https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t200000006Vut</a>

The package does not import the data, neither the translations.

The source CSV files are included in the package as static resources. But also you can find <a href="https://github.com/umabot/bkleumi-hack/tree/master/data">them here</a>

And the <a href="https://github.com/umabot/bkleumi-hack/tree/master/translation">translation file here</a>

<h2>Important salesforce.com Org Considerations for all teams</h2>

Please note that developer edition orgs have a small data capacity of 5MB and a small API call limit of 5000 calls per 24 hour period.

<h1>Salesforce Technical Help</h1>

You can of course ask onsite help. If you wish to benefit from the 1.5 million salesforce developers already using our technology, please post questions to the salesforce.com developer forums at <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/forums">developer.salesforce.com/forums</a>

For other knowledge about salesforce development visit <a href="https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/">salesforce.stackexchange.com</a>. However we will not be monitoring this channel.

If you post in English you will likely get more help as many of the members of the forums and stackexchange do not speak Hebrew. Sorry.
